# Cppoker

![CMake](https://github.com/SergioGasquez/cppoker/workflows/CMake/badge.svg)

C++ enviroment with docker intended to be used with VS Code. You'll have everything you need for C++ development and many cool features (conan, clang-format, clang-tidy, cppcheck, doxygen, unit testing..) the code template comes from [lefticus' ultimate c++/cmake project](https://github.com/lefticus/cpp_starter_project/) but with many things that I wont use in my projects deleted.
